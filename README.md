#audit database mtNotes_demo
#this folder contains some examples of Filemaker Pro GUI databases that I have created
#to use for my personal data collection.  I have included a computer science (mtCSdb)
#database that I use to organise my notes on various topics, which are in a convenient 
#drop down menu, which saves me on repetitive typing and increases data validation.
#
#
#
#mtEmbryophyta is an example of what I use to organise my notes that I carry into the
#field to help me identify plants, and collate peer reviewed articles that I have 
#gathered from a myriad of sources.  This database has the added feature of geo-location
#for a record, which I can format to lat/long or UTM.  For geo-location on iOS devices,
#the integration into a database solution is simple and quick.  For the desktop version,
#I can bulk import data from many different GPS devices, which is easily customisable
#because every device manufacturer has a slightly different data out format:)
#
#
#
#
#mtNotes is just my everyday database for my everyday stuff.  Have you ever driven to 
#the store to find that you did not bring the filter or part number?  I put everything
#I have to look up again in this db, think of this as your personal inventory and 
#catch all, the mission here is to search once, then retrieve locally many times 
#in the future.  Maybe in the future you want to look this up, but you are without
#network access, then this database becomes quite handy.
#
#I will also include a database that I use to make sense of the human languages that
#I know, always a few more rules and exceptions when compared to logical programming
#languagesâ€¦.
